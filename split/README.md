# README

- This is currently possible by using the SplitBot in Discord. The command format is

> !split <dev|community|default> percentage address

- It donates an additional <percentage> to Dev Fund, Community Fund, or the split address for Dev Fund and Community Fund, and then sends the rest of the funds to <address>.

For example,

> !split dev 5% 0x65767ec6d4d3d18a200842352485cdc37cbf3a21

- This would donate an additional 5% to Dev Fund, and sends the rest of the balance to 0x65767ec6d4d3d18a200842352485cdc37cbf3a21. 
- You can issue this command in #ask-ella-bot Discord channel, then the bot will give you an contract address. All you need to do then is to mine on this contract address.
